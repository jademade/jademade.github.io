    <p>On October 31, the <a href="https://www.businessanddisability.org" target="_blank">ILO Global Business and Disability Network</a> held its first worldwide meeting at the International Labour Organization headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. Entitled “Business as unusual: making workplaces inclusive of people with disabilities”, the meeting highlighted the importance of innovation and partnership in transforming disability inclusion into a usual, natural practice in companies. As the communication officer of the Disability Network, I contributed with preparing the <b>ILO Director-General's speech</b> [edited], creating the event and <a href="https://www.ilo.org/skills/pubs/WCMS_316815/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank">subsequent publication</a>'s titles, as well as all related communication material, and assisting with the overall organization and smooth running of the event.</p></div>
                
    <p>  
The event was divided into three sessions, with two Network business meetings and a high-level panel. The high-level panel hosted a number of speakers including the ILO’s Director-General, Guy Ryder, who emphasized the fundamental role of multinational enterprises in promoting the inclusion of people with disabilities in the labour market, and Shruti Singh (OECD), who delivered a presentation on the economic impact of mental ill-health in the workplace, “a topic that has been neglected for far too long” and at the same time “has become one of the most important economic challenges we face today”, according to Singh. </p>

                <p>
The two business meetings included disability inclusion practices from Tata Consultancy Services, L’Oréal, Employers’ Federation of Ceylon, Sodexo, Standard Bank, IBM, Audi, Wipro, Telenor, Dow and USCIB. Panelists and participants discussed how companies and organizations can transform mindsets and attitudes regarding disability misconceptions and foster inclusive and diverse workplaces.
